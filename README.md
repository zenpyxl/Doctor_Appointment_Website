This project is a web-based doctor appointment management system designed to streamline the scheduling and management of medical consultations in clinics or hospitals. It features three user roles: Admin, Doctor, and Patient.

- Admins manage doctor profiles, session schedules, and oversee appointments.
- Doctors can view their appointments, manage availability, and access patient information.
- Patients can register, browse doctor schedules, book appointments, and manage their profiles.

The platform ensures a seamless experience through a responsive interface and efficient database-driven operations, replacing traditional manual booking with a digital solution.
